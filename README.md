      }

}
```


### POST /bookings
A POST request to this endpoint will attempt to book a room at the specified time and date.

#### Authentication
The user credentials needs to be included using [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

If something like OAuth2 was applicable to this situation it would surely have been chosen as authentication method.
But since Kronox Resursbokning is made the way it is, no better solution was found than to use Basic Auth.
This in turn means that users have to trust me and my code. I could if I want to save every incoming
credential in a database. But I'm trying to be transparent by publishing the code and making it open source.

But still, you shouldn't POST to my demo of the API at Heroku. I *could* use another repo which saves the credentials, and
just *pretend* that I'm using this one (which is safe, read the code).

And maybe I am.

Hah.

No.

Seriously. I'm not. It's safe.

#### Example POST body
The POST body needs to be valid JSON and include the following attributes:
* `room` - a valid room id
* `date` - a valid date according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g. 2015-10-21
* `time` - a valid time id

```json
{
  "room": "nia0301",
  "date": "2015-12-24",
  "time": "10151300"
}
```
